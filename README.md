# ampro-bits
Here, I publish my modifications to various bits of Ampro stock software for the Z80 Little Board and Little Board Plus SBCs.

While I no longer own an actual Ampro Little Board but instead simulate one within MAME, these utilities should be useful for actual Ampro Little Board users.

If you have any questions or want to report bugs or issues, I can be reached at kattphlox@gmail.com.

Enjoy!

Programs here include:

SYSGEN - Modified version of SYSGEN to install CP/M image.  I added an option to write whatever happens to be in the scratch area where the system is loaded whether the code sees one or not at the user's peril (admonishment that the user "PROCEED WITH CAUTION" has been added to be safe).

More likely to come!

# ampro-bits
Here, I publish my modifications to various bits of Ampro stock software for the Z80 Little Board and Little Board Plus SBCs.

While I no longer own an actual Ampro Little Board but instead simulate one within MAME, these utilities should be useful for actual Ampro Little Board users.

If you have any questions or want to report bugs or issues, I can be reached at kattphlox@gmail.com.

Enjoy!
